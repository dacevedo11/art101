        <h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>

        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>The challenge of this assignment was to use functions. We created a function that takes the user input and converts it to an array, then sorts and returns the array </p>

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>The only problem I had with this lab was that I copied and pasted the path to the js file. I named the file lab7.js but the path instead said lab.js. It took me a while to realize what 
            my mistake was. I kept going over the js thinking the mistake was there but it was just one missing number 7 in the link to the js file.
        </p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>I did the X task for putting the prompt outside of the function. I prefer it this way. 
            The way I was taught when I first started programming is that functions should only do one thing. In this case, it only sorts the string. The only thing
            I did differently was moving the prompt outside of the function, and passing a argument to the function that would now take a string as a parameter. 
        </p>
